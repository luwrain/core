 * This package provides a template for the creation of a typical app for
 * LUWRAIN. We highly encourage you to utilize the classes of this
 * package since in addition to your convenience they help to create a
 * easily recognizable app covering the most important parts of our
 * experience automatically. Nevertheless, there are no things you wouldn't be able to
 * do without the classes of this package.
 * <p>
 * Two major classes of this package are {@link AppBase} and {@link LayoutBase}.  The
 * former one should be used as a superclass for the main class of your
 * application, and the second as a superclass for every layout of areas
 * your application consists of.
